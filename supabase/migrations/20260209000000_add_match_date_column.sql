-- =====================================================================
-- Migration: Add match_date column to tournament_matches
-- Purpose: Add match_date column combining tournament_date and imported_at time
-- Date: 2026-02-09
-- =====================================================================

-- Step 1: Add match_date column to tournament_matches table
ALTER TABLE nakka.tournament_matches
ADD COLUMN match_date TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Step 2: Update existing matches with combined date from tournament_date and time from imported_at
-- Extract date part (YYYY-MM-DD) from tournaments.tournament_date
-- Extract time part (HH:MI:SS) from tournament_matches.imported_at
-- Combine them to create the match_date
WITH match_updates AS (
  SELECT 
    tm.tournament_match_id,
    (
      to_char(t.tournament_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD') || ' ' || 
      to_char(tm.imported_at, 'HH24:MI:SS')
    )::TIMESTAMPTZ AS new_match_date
  FROM nakka.tournament_matches tm
  INNER JOIN nakka.tournaments t ON tm.tournament_id = t.tournament_id
)
UPDATE nakka.tournament_matches
SET match_date = match_updates.new_match_date
FROM match_updates
WHERE tournament_matches.tournament_match_id = match_updates.tournament_match_id;

-- Step 3: Make match_date NOT NULL now that all existing records have values
ALTER TABLE nakka.tournament_matches
ALTER COLUMN match_date SET NOT NULL;

-- Step 4: Set default value for future inserts (use imported_at as default)
ALTER TABLE nakka.tournament_matches
ALTER COLUMN match_date SET DEFAULT NOW();

-- Step 5: Create index on match_date for query performance
CREATE INDEX idx_tournament_matches_match_date 
  ON nakka.tournament_matches(match_date DESC);

-- Step 6: Add comment
COMMENT ON COLUMN nakka.tournament_matches.match_date IS 'Match date/time combining tournament date with import time. Used for chronological ordering of matches.';

-- Step 7: Update the player_match_result type to include match_date
-- First, drop all existing functions that use this type
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS nakka.get_player_matches_by_nickname(TEXT[], INTEGER) CASCADE;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS nakka.get_player_match_by_id_and_nickname(INTEGER, TEXT) CASCADE;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS nakka.get_player_matches_by_tournament_and_nickname(TEXT, TEXT, INTEGER) CASCADE;

-- Drop and recreate the type with the new field
